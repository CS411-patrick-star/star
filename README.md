# star
The "star" directory is the back end's root directory.
The "star-client" directory is the front end's root directory.

Similar to a web application, back end and the front end are run separately.

To run the back end, "star" directory should be opened.
If it doesn't set the sources root file for the back end automatically, the sources root file should be set as star/src/main/backend/java package.

To run the front end, "star-client" directory should be opened.
After opening the directory, from the terminal, "npm install" command should run first.
After that, "npm start" command should run in order to run the front end.
